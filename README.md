# Empowering Clients: Self-Adaptive Federated Learning for Data Quality Challenges
This repository is the official implementation of FedSRC-

>ðŸ“‹ Federated Learning (FL) suffers from performance degradation in the global model due to the quality and reliability of clients' locally generated data. Some prior studies address this by limiting or discarding certain clients' contributions to the global model, resulting in unnecessary computation and communication for the discarded clients. While active client selection may avoid this resource waste, it requires client-level profiling that violates privacy. In this paper, we present a novel FL approach, called FedSRC: Federated Learning with Self-Regulating Clients, that can save clients' computation and communication resources while preserving their anonymity. In FedSRC, clients determine if their local training is favorable to the global model and whether they should participate in an FL round using a lightweight checkpoint using the local test loss on the global model and refined heterogeneity index (RHI).
Through comprehensive evaluations using four datasets, we show that FedSRC can reduce communication costs by up to 30\% and computation costs by 55\%.
## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
>ðŸ“‹  Getting Dataset Directly
- You can directly download the Dataset for FEMNIST [FEMNIST TRAIN](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dhwHcwHvgHGraG-OMXzVA4WrpiNLoqAV/view?usp=sharing), [FEMNIST TEST](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oe3yEPa2TruLkEOTLsZtipZjERBs-a1M/view?usp=sharing)
- For other datasets, those are processed during training and downloaded online.

Keep the dataset in the same directory of the dataset name.

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, navigate to the directory and run this command:


CIFAR10 Non-IID training for FedSRC
```
python fedsrc cifar10 noniid.py
```

>ðŸ“‹ You can control the number of clients, the percentage of bad clients, and the percentage of clients blockig from the code for any algorithms. The code for different algorithms is in different files.

## Evaluation

Data is saved as the data section with the same directory name at code section. You can evaluate the model performances from there using code like-:

```eval
python cifar10 noniid accuracy.py
```

>ðŸ“‹  You can asses both the accuracy, and loss of the clients as well as the global server along with model weights and other information from the data section.
